# SOAP-NOTES

SOAP NOTES

SOAP NOTES is an innovative project designed to streamline the documentation process for chiropractic office visits. By leveraging a chat model and the Whisper API, SOAP NOTES takes dictation text rendered from audio recordings of patient visits and extracts relevant information to populate a SOAP-formatted note. This process covers all critical aspects of documentation: Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, thereby simplifying the creation of comprehensive and structured office visit notes.
Features

    Audio Transcription: Utilizes the Whisper API to transcribe audio recordings of patient visits.
    Information Extraction: Employs a chat model to intelligently parse and extract key information from transcribed text.
    SOAP Note Generation: Automatically formats extracted information into a structured SOAP note, encompassing:
        Subjective: The patient's description of their condition or concern.
        Objective: Objective observations made by the chiropractor, including physical exam findings and diagnostic test results.
        Assessment: The chiropractor's diagnosis or assessment of the patient's condition.
        Plan: The treatment plan for the patient, including any prescribed therapy or follow-up.
